is an engine for making simple but cool text based rpgs, good for start programming and making games.

###how it works?

in the folder 'Project Start' you will start a project it automates you the process of making a folder for the game and for the other files.

###why should i use that?

making games is hard and you need really complex coding that is hard to understand.

this is the reason why i used python for the project, with it's simple syntax i maded something that help all the people that whant to learn game developing.
